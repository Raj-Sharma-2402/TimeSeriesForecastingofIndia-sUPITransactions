# Time Series Analysis of UPI Transactions  

## Overview  
This project explores **Time Series Analysis** using **UPI transaction data** from the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**. The goal is to analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns in the dataset and develop predictive models using **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** techniques.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of **UPI transactions** with the following attributes:  
1. **Date of transaction**  
2. **Volume (in Lakhs)**  
3. **Value (in INR Crores)**  

The dataset is sourced from **[RBIâ€™s official website](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49901#)**.  

## Key Analysis & Methods  
### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting dates.  
- Trend Visualization: Monthly and yearly transaction trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- Seasonality Detection: Fourier Transform-based **Periodogram** analysis.  
- Feature Engineering: Differencing to make the data **stationary**.  

### **2. Statistical Tests**  
- **Dickey-Fuller Test** for stationarity check.  
- **Autocorrelation & Partial Autocorrelation (ACF & PACF)** to determine time-dependent relationships.  

### **3. Time Series Modeling**  
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model for short-term forecasting.  
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** model to account for seasonal effects.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using `pmdarima.auto_arima`.  
- **Residual Analysis**: Checking model assumptions and performance.  

### **4. Model Validation & Forecasting**  
- Train-Test Split (80-20).  
- Ljung-Box test for residual independence.  
- Forecasting future UPI transaction volumes and values.  

## Results  
- **ARIMA(3,1,1) and ARIMA(2,1,1)** were the best models for transaction **Volume** and **Value**, respectively.  
- **SARIMA(1,0,3)(1,1,1,30)** captured seasonality in UPI transactions.  
- **Ljung-Box test** confirmed residual independence, indicating a good model fit.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Time Series Modeling** (ARIMA, SARIMA)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis
